Files:
- lfsa000a21a_e.shp is the shape file of each forward sortation area (FSA) in Canada. Source: https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a883eb14-0c0e-45c4-b8c4-b54c4a819edb
- FSA_Center_fixed includes:
  - coord_text: center location coordinates with logitudes and latitudes, converted for GMaps to use. Gmap can read the format (XX, -XXX). AB is located in north & west hemisphere. The binary "fix_ind" variable indicates if the traveling distance has been manually fixed.
  - the traveling distance to the testing center (Data Collection Center) located in Calgary, in meters.


Notes:
- To load the shape file (.shp), make sure it's located in the same folder along with other files (.shx, .prj, .dbf, .xml).
- The center point of each polygon was not always located in the polygon (this happened to some U-shaped regions), this can be fixed, but might not be a big problem here.
- The FSAs located with in 50km should be those around Calgary, those has distance ~300 km should be located in Edmonton. 
- Few FSAs got NA in their traveling distance var, probably because the center of those FSAs polygon are located in a lake or something. This part was manually fixed using Google Map Website.
- Some people may be closer to a site outside of their province, might want to think of how to handle that. A: In Alberta, probably we don't need to worry to much about this. The closest data collection site in BC is located around Vancouver. For most places in AB it means >750 km of traveling.
