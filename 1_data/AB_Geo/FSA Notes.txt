Files:
- lfsa000a21a_e.shp is the shape file of each FSAs in Canada.
- FSA_Center.csv is the exported version of center location data. This file includes converted location with logitudes and latitudes.
- FSA_Center_Converted.xlsx includes center location coordinates for GMaps to use. Gmap can read the format (XX, -XXX). AB is located in north & west hemisphere.
- FSA_Center_fixed includes the traveling distance to the testing center (Data Collection Center) located in Calgary, in meters.


Notes:
- The center point of each polygon was not always located in the polygon (this happened to some U-shaped regions), this can be fixed, but might not be a big problem here.
- The FSAs located with in 50km should be those around Calgary, those has distance ~300 km should be located in Edmonton. 
- Few FSAs got NA in their traveling distance var, probably because the center of those FSAs polygon are located in a lake or something. This part was manually fixed using Google Map Website.
- Some people may be closer to a site outside of their province, might want to think of how to handle that. A: In Alberta, probably we don't need to worry to much about this. The closest data collection site in BC is located around Vancouver. For most places in AB it means >750 km of traveling.
