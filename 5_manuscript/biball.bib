  abstract = {The implementation and evaluation of malaria control programs would be greatly facilitated by new tools for the rapid assessment of malaria transmission intensity. Because acquisition and maintenance of antimalarial antibodies depend on exposure to malaria infection, such antibodies might be used as proxy measures of transmission intensity. We have compared the prevalence of IgG antibodies with three Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage antigens in individuals of all ages living at varying altitudes encompassing a range of transmission intensities from hyper- to hypoendemic in northeastern Tanzania, with alternative measures of transmission intensity. The prevalence of antibodies to merozoite surface protein-1(19) was significantly more closely correlated with altitude than either point-prevalence malaria parasitemia or single measures of hemoglobin concentration. Analysis of age-specific seroprevalence rates enabled differentiation of recent (seasonal) changes in transmission intensity from longer-term transmission trends and, using a mathematical model of the annual rate of seroconversion, estimation of the longevity of the antibody response. Thus, serological tools allow us to detect variations in malaria transmission over time. Such tools will be invaluable for monitoring trends in malaria endemicity and the effectiveness of malaria control programs.},

  abstract = {In the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is paramount for monitoring immune responses in postauthorization vaccination and seroepidemiological studies. However, large-scale and iterative serological testing by venipuncture in older persons can be challenging. Capillary blood sampling using a finger prick and collection on protein saver cards, i.e., dried blood spots (DBSs), has already proven to be a promising alternative. However, elderly persons have reduced cutaneous microvasculature, which may affect DBS-based antibody testing. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of DBS tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among nursing homes residents. We collected paired venous blood and DBS samples on two types of protein saver cards (Whatman and EUROIMMUN) from nursing home residents, as well as from staff members as a reference population. Venous blood samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the Abbott chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). DBS samples were analyzed by the EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We performed a statistical assessment to optimize the ELISA cutoff value for the DBS testing using Youden's J index. A total of 273 paired DBS-serum samples were analyzed, of which 129 were positive, as assessed by the reference test. The sensitivities and specificities of DBS testing ranged from 95.0\% to 97.1\% and from 97.1\% to 98.8\%, respectively, depending on the population (residents or staff members) and the DBS card type. Therefore, we found that DBS sampling is a valid alternative to venipuncture for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among elderly subjects., IMPORTANCE Since the implementation of newly developed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the general population, serological tests are of increasing importance. Because DBS samples can be obtained with a finger prick and can be shipped and stored at room temperature, they are optimal for use in large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance or postauthorization vaccination studies, even in an elderly study population.},

We quantified and compared anti-spike (S) antibodies using different commercial immunoassays. We tested serum samples from 70 SARS-CoV-2-naive health care workers 2 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of BNT162b2, 2 and 4 weeks, and 3 months after the second dose of BNT162b2. The following quantitative assays were used: Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche-S), Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant [Abbott-IgG(S)], and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM (Abbott-IgM). All samples tested positive for Roche-S and Abbott-IgG antibodies after the second dose, with 83.6\% Abbott-IgM positive rate. Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) correlated significantly in all samples (r~=~0.920, p~{$<~$}0.0001), and the Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) assay showed a strong correlation with each other at each time point after vaccination. Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers were correlated with age; their rate of decline was age-dependent in males but not in females. Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers decreased from 2 weeks after the second dose. Roche-S antibody titers peaked 2 weeks after the second dose in 76.2\% of the participants; the titers recovered 3 months post-vaccination after declining at week 4 in 40.7\% of the participants. The concordance between Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers over time was 47.5\%. Most participants presented significantly high Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers after immunization. Some measurements were inconsistent with titer changes between these assays, possibly because of differences in the immunoglobulin-specificity of the kits.},

  abstract = {The Abbott Laboratories SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the DiaSorin LIASON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay are both chemiluminescent immunoassays that qualitatively detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The Abbott assay detects IgG against the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the DiaSorin assay uses antigen derived from the viral spike (S) protein. Here we evaluate the performance of these two assays at our institution.45 patient samples (serum or plasma) were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by both the Abbott and DiaSorin assays. The samples were previously characterized at a national reference laboratory using the Abbott assay or by an in-house PCR-based test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Samples yielding discordant results across platforms were further tested using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay at the reference laboratory.22 samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by the reference lab Abbott assay, and 23 tested positive by the same reference lab test (n = 13) or by an in-house PCR-based test (n = 10). The 22 samples characterized as negative again tested negative by both the Abbott (in-house) and DiaSorin assays (100\% NPA). Among the 23 samples characterized as positive, all 23 tested positive by the Abbott assay (100\% PPA), while only 15 tested positive by the DiaSorin assay (65\% PPA). For each of the 8 discordant cases, samples were further tested by EUROIMMUN assay, which targets the S protein; 7 of the 8 samples tested negative by this assay, in agreement with the DiaSorin test results. Thus, for the discordant cases, testing for IgG against N (in-house and reference lab Abbott assays) gave positive results, while testing for IgG against S (DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays) mostly gave negative results.These findings highlight the importance of the differences between various SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, and providers should be aware of the specific antigenic target(s) in each test. Selection of a specific assay may depend on the need to assess past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (for which a nucleocapsid target may be more sensitive) or to detect neutralizing antibodies (for which a spike target may be more relevant). This also has implications for disease surveillance as reliance on anti-spike antibodies alone may underestimate infection prevalence.All Authors: No reported disclosures},

Andersen's Model of Healthcare Utilization allowed the categorization of the independent variables into the following: (1) predisposing factors, including sociodemographic variables and health beliefs; (2) enabling factors, including socioeconomic status and access to care; and (3) need for care, including preexisting or newly diagnosed conditions and reasons to seek out care or to utilize a new mode of care. Methods. Potential respondents (n=4,077) were identified for recruitment from a volunteer registry in Arkansas. Recruitment emails provided a study description, the opportunity to verify meeting the study's inclusion criteria and to consent for participation, and a link to follow to complete the survey online. The online survey responses were collected between July and August of 2020 (n=1,137). Results. Telehealth utilization included two categories: (1) utilizers reported the first use of telehealth services during the pandemic, and (2) nonutilizers reported they had never used telehealth. Lower odds of reporting telehealth utilization during the pandemic were associated with race (Black; OR=0.57, CI [0.33, 0.96]) and education (high School or less; OR=0.45, CI [0.25, 0.83]). Higher odds of reporting telehealth utilization included having more than one provider (OR=2.33, CI [1.30, 4.18]), more physical (OR=1.12, CI [1.00, 1.25]) and mental (OR 1.53, CI [1.24, 1.88]) health conditions, and changes in healthcare delivery during the pandemic (OR=3.49, CI [2.78, 4.38]). Conclusions. The results illustrate that disparities exist in Arkansans' utilization of telehealth services during the pandemic. Future research should explore the disparities in telehealth utilization and how telehealth may be used to address disparities in care for Black Arkansans and those with low socioeconomic status.},

  abstract = {Background Many studies report the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. We aimed to synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the level and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases, preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location, and seroprevalence estimate. We corrected estimates for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian measurement error models, conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634. Results We identified 968 seroprevalence studies including 9.3 million participants in 74 countries. There were 472 studies (49\%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5\%, IQR 2.4\textendash 8.4\%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6\% perinatal) to high (59\% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6\% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5\% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p{$<$}0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p{$<$}0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95\% CI 2.64\textendash 4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95\% CI 1.96\textendash 3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95\% CI 1.01\textendash 32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.60\textendash 2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18\textendash 64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.11\textendash 1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95\% CI 1.28\textendash 3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9\textendash 38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames. Discussion Most of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, until vaccine-derived herd immunity is achieved. Improvements in serosurvey design and reporting are needed for ongoing monitoring of infection prevalence and the pandemic response.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Telemedicine is increasingly being offered to patients for rheumatology care, but few studies have examined factors associated with telemedicine use or outcomes of telemedicine in rheumatology. The objective of this analysis was to determine factors associated with the use of video telemedicine when offered as part of usual care for follow-up of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Individuals in the Alaska Tribal Health System with a diagnosis of RA were recruited when seeing a rheumatologist either in-person or by video telemedicine, both of which were offered as part of usual care. At the study visit, participants completed the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) and a telemedicine perception survey and agreed to a medical record review for demographics and disease characteristics. Data from this visit were analyzed to determine factors associated with using telemedicine for RA, compared to being seen in-person only. RESULTS: Of 122 participants enrolled in the study, 56 (46\%) had been seen by telemedicine at least once. Factors associated with telemedicine use in univariate analysis included a higher RAPID3 score, a higher number of rheumatologist visits in the preceding year, more positive perceptions of telemedicine, and seeing a physician who used telemedicine more often. On multivariate analysis, these 4 factors all remained significant. Demographic and other disease-related factors or comorbidities were not associated with telemedicine use. CONCLUSION: When offered as an option for rheumatology care, video telemedicine was more likely to be used by RA patients with higher disease activity and more positive perceptions of telemedicine, and by patients whose physicians used telemedicine more often.},

  abstract = {Background High-throughput sequencing has enabled detailed insights into complex microbial environments, including the human gut microbiota. The accuracy of the sequencing data however, is reliant upon appropriate storage of the samples prior to DNA extraction. The aim of this study was to conduct the first MiSeq sequencing investigation into the effects of faecal storage on the microbiota, compared to fresh samples. Culture-based analysis was also completed. Methods Seven faecal samples were collected from healthy adults. Samples were separated into fresh (DNA extracted immediately), snap frozen on dry ice and frozen for 7 days at -80\textdegree C prior to DNA extraction or samples frozen at -80\textdegree C for 7 days before DNA extraction. Sequencing was completed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Culturing of total aerobes, anaerobes and bifidobacteria was also completed. Results No significant differences at phylum or family levels between the treatment groups occurred. At genus level only Faecalibacterium and Leuconostoc were significantly different in the fresh samples compared to the snap frozen group (p = 0.0298; p = 0.0330 respectively). Diversity analysis indicated that samples clustered based on the individual donor, rather than by storage group. No significant differences occurred in the culture-based analysis between the fresh, snap or -80\textdegree C frozen samples. Conclusions Using the MiSeq platform coupled with culture-based analysis, this study highlighted that limited significant changes in microbiota occur following rapid freezing of faecal samples prior to DNA extraction. Thus, rapid freezing of samples prior to DNA extraction and culturing, preserves the integrity of the microbiota.},

The article formally shows the inherent connections among the MMW-S method, propensity score stratification, and inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW). Both MMW-S and IPTW are suitable for evaluating multiple concurrent treatments, and hence have broader applications than matching, stratification, or covariance adjustment for the propensity score. Furthermore, mathematical consideration and a series of simulations reveal that the MMW-S method has incorporated some important strengths of the propensity score stratification method, which generally enhance the robustness of MMW-S estimates in comparison with IPTW estimates. To illustrate, the author applies the MMW-S method to evaluations of within-class homogeneous grouping in early elementary reading instruction.},

The research develops five hypotheses to test the influence of a disease outbreak on the rate of telemedicine adoption. The method used for the study is the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the sampling method used for the study is purposive sampling. The respondents were taken from a multispecialty clinic in North India and the sample size for the study is 43. The study concludes that patients are seeing more value in the use of telemedicine during COVID-19.

  abstract = {Background: Disparities in telemedicine use by race, age, and income have been consistently documented. To date, research has focused on telemedicine use among patients with adequate insurance coverage. To address this gap, this study identifies patient-level factors associated with telemedicine use during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among one free clinic network's patients who are underinsured or uninsured. Methods: Electronic health record data were reviewed for patient-level data on patients seen from March 2020 to September 2020. Patients were grouped by telemedicine use history. We controlled for sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity) and comorbidities. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Across 198 adult patients, 56.6\% received telemedicine care. Of these, 99.1\% elected for audio-only telemedicine instead of video telemedicine. Telemedicine use was more likely among those living within 15 miles of their clinic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\,=\,4.43, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-11.53). It was less likely to be used by older patients (aOR\,=\,0.97, 95\% CI 0.94-1.00), patients of male sex (aOR\,=\,0.85, 95\% CI 0.18-0.92), and those establishing care as a new patient (aOR\,=\,0.01, 95\% CI 0.00-0.07). Conclusion: The moderate usage of telemedicine suggests that its implementation in free clinics may be feasible. Solutions specific to patients with smartphone-only internet access are needed to improve the use of video telemedicine as smartphone-specific factors (e.g., data use limits) may influence the ability for underserved patients to receive video telemedicine.},

  abstract = {Background: The prevalence of infection in Canada's COVID-19 viral waves, the predictors of infection, and the durability of antibody responses to infection remain undocumented.Methods: We organized serial online surveys of a representative group of Canadian adults about their COVID experience in the first (n=19 994; April-July 2020) and second viral wave (n=14 621; October 2020-March 2021). We paired these with IgG analysis of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in self-collected dried blood spots after the first (n=8967) and second (n=7102) waves.Findings: Canada's cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among unvaccinated adults rose from \textasciitilde 2\% after the first wave to 7\% after the second. The seropositivity pattern was heterogeneous demographically and geographically during the first wave, but more homogeneous by the second (except in the four Atlantic Provinces, cumulative seroprevalence \textasciitilde 3\%). Seroprevalence among visible minorities rose sharply from about 2\% to {$>$}8\% from the first to second wave. About a quarter of those reporting COVID symptoms during the second wave were seropositive, and in both waves the odds ratio (OR) of seropositivity for COVID symptoms exceeded six. About one-fifth of seropositives reported no symptoms. Of 134 seropositive adults in the first wave who were retested after the second, 83\% (111) remained seropositive at least seven months later. Current smokers and people with a history of diabetes had lower ORs of infection. We calculated the absolute numbers of seropositive adults nationwide, which nearly quadrupled from 0.57 million to 1.90 million, with the largest increases among older adults. Infection fatality rates fell from 3.7 to 2.6/1000 infections, most notably at older ages.Interpretation: Canada's COVID pandemic grew substantially between the first and second viral waves. Home-based DBS collection offers a practicable way to document evolving demographic and geographic patterns and to assess the levels and durability of population immunity, including from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.Funding: Pfizer Global Medical, Unity Health Foundation, and the Canadian COVID-19 Immunity Task Force. Declaration of Interest: None to declare. Ethical Approval: The Ab-C study was approved by the Unity Health Toronto Ethics Review Board.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore whether racial/ethnic differences in telehealth use existed during the peak pandemic period among NYC patients seeking care for COVID-19 related symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used data from a large health system in NYC - the epicenter of the US crisis - to describe characteristics of patients seeking COVID-related care via telehealth, ER, or office encounters during the peak pandemic period. Using multinomial logistic regression, we estimated the magnitude of the relationship between patient characteristics and the odds of having a first encounter via telehealth versus ER or office visit, and then used regression parameter estimates to predict patients' probabilities of using different encounter types given their characteristics. RESULTS: Demographic factors, including race/ethnicity and age, were significantly predictive of telehealth use. As compared to Whites, Blacks had higher adjusted odds of using both the ER versus telehealth (OR: 4.3, 95\% CI: 4.0-4.6) and office visits versus telehealth (OR: 1.4, 95\% CI: 1.3-1.5). For Hispanics versus Whites, the analogous ORs were 2.5 (95\% CI: 2.3-2.7) and 1.2 (95\% CI: 1.1-1.3). Compared to any age groups, patients 65+ had significantly higher odds of using either ER or office visits versus telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: The response to COVID-19 has involved an unprecedented expansion in telehealth. While older Americans and minority populations among others are known to be disadvantaged by the digital divide, few studies have examined disparities in telehealth specifically, and none during COVID-19. Additional research into sociodemographic heterogeneity in telehealth use is needed to prevent potentially further exacerbating health disparities overall.},

In this study, we characterized humoral and cellular antigen-specific anti-SARS-CoV2 responses following COVID-19 vaccination in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) receiving anti-CD20 therapy, who were either B-cell depleted, or B-cell recovered at the time of vaccination and in normal control subjects. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike (S) and anti-nucleocapsid (NC) antibodies were measured using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, while SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell responses to S glycoprotein subunits 1 (S1) and 2 (S2) and receptor binding domain peptide pools were measured using interferon-gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assays. In total, 26 recently vaccinated subjects were studied. Despite the lack of a measurable humoral immune response, B-cell depleted patients mounted a similar vaccine induced antigen-specific T-cell response compared to B-cell recovered patients and normal controls. Our data indicate that to assure a humoral response in patients receiving anti-CD20 therapy, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should ideally be delayed until B-cell recovery (CD-20 positive B-cells {$>$} 10/{$\mu$}l). Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination elicits robust, potentially protective cellular immune responses in these subjects. Further research to characterize the durability and protective effect of vaccine-induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell immunity are needed.},

Preprints were included.Selected studies for this systematic review and meta-analysis were original articles reporting estimates of VE over time against laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic disease.Estimates of VE at different time points from vaccination were retrieved from original studies. A secondary data analysis was performed to project VE at any time from last dose administration, improving the comparability across different studies and between the 2 considered variants. Pooled estimates were obtained from random-effects meta-analysis.Outcomes were VE against laboratory-confirmed Omicron or Delta infection and symptomatic disease and half-life and waning rate associated with vaccine-induced protection.A total of 799 original articles and 149 reviews published in peer-reviewed journals and 35 preprints were identified. Of these, 40 studies were included in the analysis. Pooled estimates of VE of a primary vaccination cycle against laboratory-confirmed Omicron infection and symptomatic disease were both lower than 20\% at 6 months from last dose administration. Booster doses restored VE to levels comparable to those acquired soon after the administration of the primary cycle. However, 9 months after booster administration, VE against Omicron was lower than 30\% against laboratory-confirmed infection and symptomatic disease. The half-life of VE against symptomatic infection was estimated to be 87 days (95\% CI, 67-129 days) for Omicron compared with 316 days (95\% CI, 240-470 days) for Delta. Similar waning rates of VE were found for different age segments of the population.These findings suggest that the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against laboratory-confirmed Omicron or Delta infection and symptomatic disease rapidly wanes over time after the primary vaccination cycle and booster dose. These results can inform the design of appropriate targets and timing for future vaccination programs.},

Our objective was to assess SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in a representative sample of pregnant people throughout Canada, across multiple time points over 2 years of the pandemic, to describe the seroprevalence and show the ability of this process to provide prevalence estimates. Methods: This Canadian retrospective serological surveillance study used existing serological prenatal samples across 10 provinces over multiple time periods: Feb. 3\textendash 21, 2020; Aug. 24\textendash Sept. 11, 2020; Nov. 16\textendash Dec. 4, 2020; Nov. 15\textendash Dec. 3, 2021; and results from the province of British Columbia during a period in which the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant was predominant, from Nov. 15, 2021, to June 11, 2022. Age and postal code administrative data allowed for comparison with concurrent polymerase chain reactivity (PCR)\textendash positive results collected by Statistics Canada and the Canadian Surveillance of COVID-19 in Pregnancy (CANCOVID-Preg) project. Results: Seropositivity in antenatal serum as early as February 2020 indicates SARS-CoV-2 transmission before the World Health Organization's declaration of the pandemic. Seroprevalence in our sample of pregnant people was 1.84 to 8.90 times higher than the recorded concurrent PCR-positive prevalence recorded among females aged 20\textendash 49 years in November\textendash December 2020. Overall seropositivity in our sample of pregnant people was low at the end of 2020, increasing to 15\% in 1 province by the end of 2021. Seroprevalence among pregnant people in BC during the Omicron period increased from 5.8\% to 43\% from November 2021 to June 2022. Interpretation: These results indicate widespread vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccine availability in Canada. During the time periods sampled, public health tracking systems were under-reporting infections, and seroprevalence results during the Omicron period indicate extensive community spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

  abstract = {Antibodies serve as biomarkers of infection, but if sustained can confer long-term immunity. Yet, for most clinically approved vaccines, binding antibody titers only serve as a surrogate of protection. Instead, the ability of vaccine induced antibodies to neutralize or mediate Fc-effector functions is mechanistically linked to protection. While evidence has begun to point to persisting antibody responses among SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, cases of re-infection have begun to emerge, calling the protective nature of humoral immunity against this highly infectious pathogen into question. Using a community-based surveillance study, we aimed to define the relationship between titers and functional antibody activity to SARS-CoV-2 over time. Here we report significant heterogeneity, but limited decay, across antibody titers amongst 120 identified seroconverters, most of whom had asymptomatic infection. Notably, neutralization, Fc-function, and SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses were only observed in subjects that elicited RBD-specific antibody titers above a threshold. The findings point to a switch-like relationship between observed antibody titer and function, where a distinct threshold of activity\textemdash defined by the level of antibodies\textemdash is required to elicit vigorous humoral and cellular response. This response activity level may be essential for durable protection, potentially explaining why re-infections occur with SARS-CoV-2 and other common coronaviruses.},

Methods HCW were tested at T0 (day of first dose), T1 (day of second dose) and T2 (2\textendash 3~weeks after second dose) for IgG anti-nucleocapsid protein, IgM anti-spike protein and IgG anti-receptor binding domain (IgG-RBD-S). The antibody response was compared between four main groups: group A, individuals with previous infection and positive antibodies at baseline; group B, individuals with the same history but negative antibodies; group C, individuals with no infection history but positive antibodies; group D, naive individuals. Repeated measures analysis was used to compare results over time-points. Results A total of 1935 HCW were included. Median IgG-RBD-S titre was significantly higher for group A (232 individuals) than for group B (56 individuals) both at T1 (A: 22~763 AU/mL, interquartile range (IQR) 14~222\textendash 37 204 AU/mL; B: 1373 AU/mL, IQR 783\textendash 3078 AU/mL, p 0.0003) and T2 (A: 30~765 AU/mL, IQR 19~841\textendash 42 813 AU/mL; B: 13~171 AU/mL, IQR 2324\textendash 22 688 AU/mL, p 0.0038) and for group D (1563 individuals; 796 AU/mL, IQR 379\textendash 1510 AU/mL at T1; 15~494 AU/mL, IQR 9122\textendash 23 916 AU/mL at T2, p~{$<~$}0.0001 for both time-points). T1 values of group A were also significantly higher than T2 values of group D (p~{$<~$}0.0001). Presence of symptoms, younger age and being female were associated with stronger antibody response. HCW infected in March showed a significantly stronger response (T1: 35~324 AU/mL, IQR 22~003\textendash 44 531 AU/mL; T2: 37~648 AU/mL, IQR 27~088\textendash 50 451 AU/mL) than those infected in November (T1: 18~499 AU/mL, IQR 11~492\textendash 27 283 AU/mL; T2: 23~210 AU/mL, IQR 18~074\textendash 36 086 AU/mL, p~{$<~$}0.0001 for both time-points. Conclusions Individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection had a strong antibody response after one single vaccine shot. A single dose might be sufficient for this group, regardless of the time elapsed since infection; however, the clinical correlation with antibody response needs to be studied.},

  abstract = {We systematically evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity in a provincial cohort to understand the local epidemiology of COVID-19 and support evidence-based public health decisions. Residual blood samples were collected for serology testing over 5-day periods monthly from June 2020 to January 2021 from six clinical laboratories across the province of Alberta, Canada. A total of 93,993 individual patient samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody assay with positives confirmed using a spike antibody assay. Population-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity was 0.92\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 0.93\%) shortly after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, increasing to 4.63\% (95\% CI: 4.61 to 4.65\%) amid the second wave in January 2021. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between males and females (1.39\% versus 1.27\%; P\,=\,0.11). Ages with highest seropositivity were 0 to 9\,years (2.71\%, 95\% CI: 1.64 to 3.78\%) followed by 20 to 29\,years (1.58\%, 95\% CI: 1.12 to 2.04\%), with the lowest rates seen in those aged 70 to 79 (0.79\%, 95\% CI: 0.65 to 0.93\%) and {$>$}80 (0.78\%, 95\% CI: 0.60 to 0.97\%). Compared to the seronegative group, seropositive patients inhabited geographic areas with lower household income (\$87,500 versus \$97,500; P\,{$<$}\,0.001), larger household sizes, and higher proportions of people with education levels of secondary school or lower, as well as immigrants and visible minority groups (all P\,{$<$}\,0.05). A total of 53.7\% of seropositive individuals were potentially undetected cases with no prior positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (NAAT). Antibodies were detectable in some patients up to 9 months post positive NAAT result. This seroprevalence study will continue to inform public health decisions by identifying at-risk demographics and geographical areas. IMPORTANCE Using SARS-CoV-2 serology testing, we assessed the proportion of people in Alberta, Canada (population 4.4 million) positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating previous infection, during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic (prior to vaccination programs). Linking these results with sociodemographic population data provides valuable information as to which groups of the population are more likely to have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus to help facilitate public health decision-making and interventions. We also compared seropositivity data with previous COVID-19 molecular testing results. Absence of antibody and molecular testing were highly correlated (95\% negative concordance). Positive antibody correlation with a previous positive molecular test was low, suggesting the possibility of mild/asymptomatic infection or other reasons leading individuals from seeking medical attention. Our data highlight that the true estimate of population prevalence of COVID-19 is likely best informed by combining data from both serology and molecular testing.},

We evaluated sensitivity and specificity of five different widely used commercial serological assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2\textendash specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies using reverse transcriptase-PCR assay in nasopharyngeal swab as reference standard test.Methods: A total of 337 plasma samples collected in the period April\textendash June 2020 from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive (n = 207) and negative (n = 130) subjects were investigated by one point-of-care lateral flow immunochromatographic assay (LFIA IgG and IgM, Technogenetics) and four fully automated assays: two chemiluminescence immunoassays (CLIA-iFlash IgG and IgM, Shenzhen YHLO Biotech and CLIA-LIAISON\textregistered{} XL IgG, DiaSorin), one electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA-Elecsys\textregistered{} total predominant IgG, Roche), and one enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA IgA, Euroimmune).Results: The overall sensitivity of all IgG serological assays was {$>$}80\% and the specificity was {$>$}97\%. The sensitivity of IgG assays was lower within 2 weeks from the onset of symptoms ranging from 70.8 to 80\%. The LFIA and CLIA-iFlash IgM showed an overall low sensitivity of 47.6 and 54.6\%, while the specificity was 98.5 and 96.2\%, respectively. The ELISA IgA yielded a sensitivity of 84.3\% and specificity of 81.7\%. However, the ELISA IgA result was indeterminate in 11.7\% of cases.Conclusions: IgG serological assays seem to be a reliable tool for the retrospective diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. IgM assays seem to have a low sensitivity and IgA assay is limited by a substantial rate of indeterminate results.},

Although nucleic acid amplifications tests (NAAT) are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnostic testing, serological assays provide better population-level SARS-CoV-2 prevalence estimates. Implementing large sero-surveys present several logistical challenges within Canada due its unique geography including rural and remote communities. Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling is a practical solution but comparative performance data on SARS-CoV-2 serological tests using DBS is currently lacking. Here we present test performance data from a well-characterized SARS-CoV-2 DBS panel sent to laboratories across Canada representing 10 commercial and 2 in-house developed tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Three commercial assays identified all positive and negative DBS correctly corresponding to a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100\% (95\% CI = 72.2, 100). Two in-house assays also performed equally well. In contrast, several commercial assays could not achieve a sensitivity greater than 40\% or a negative predictive value greater than 60\%. Our findings represent the foundation for future validation studies on DBS specimens that will play a central role in strengthening Canada's public health policy in response to COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Objectives Antibody testing against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been instrumental in detecting previous exposures and analyzing vaccine-elicited immune responses. Here, we describe a scalable solution to detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, discriminate between natural infection- and vaccination-induced responses, and assess antibody-mediated inhibition of the spike-angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) interaction. Methods We developed methods and reagents to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The main assays focus on the parallel detection of immunoglobulin (Ig)Gs against the spike trimer, its receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N). We automated a surrogate neutralisation (sn)ELISA that measures inhibition of ACE2-spike or -RBD interactions by antibodies. The assays were calibrated to a World Health Organization reference standard. Results Our single-point IgG-based ELISAs accurately distinguished non-infected and infected individuals. For seroprevalence assessment (in a non-vaccinated cohort), classifying a sample as positive if antibodies were detected for {$\geq$} 2 of the 3 antigens provided the highest specificity. In vaccinated cohorts, increases in anti-spike and -RBD (but not -N) antibodies are observed. We present detailed protocols for serum/plasma or dried blood spots analysis performed manually and on automated platforms. The snELISA can be performed automatically at single points, increasing its scalability. Conclusions Measuring antibodies to three viral antigens and identify neutralising antibodies capable of disrupting spike-ACE2 interactions in high-throughput enables large-scale analyses of humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. The reagents are available to enable scaling up of standardised serological assays, permitting inter-laboratory data comparison and aggregation.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of immunity are crucial to understanding the long-term patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48-142 days after the initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than 1 year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalized individuals, a year for hospitalized individuals, and the effective reproduction number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst-case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387 000 infectious individuals and 125 000 daily new cases; threefold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggest that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as immunity to reinfection is not permanent.

Data from a randomized efficacy trial of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine in the United Kingdom was analyzed to determine the antibody levels associated with protection against SARS-CoV-2. Binding and neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and noninfected vaccine recipients. Higher levels of all immune markers were correlated with a reduced risk of symptomatic infection. A vaccine efficacy of 80\% against symptomatic infection with majority Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved with 264 (95\%\,CI: 108, 806) binding antibody units (BAU)/ml: and 506 (95\%\,CI: 135, not computed (beyond data range) (NC)) BAU/ml for anti-spike and anti-RBD antibodies, and 26 (95\%\,CI: NC, NC) international unit (IU)/ml and 247 (95\%\,CI: 101, NC) normalized neutralization titers (NF50) for pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization, respectively.

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus~2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected 78~million individuals and is responsible for over 1.7~million deaths to date. Infection is associated with the development of variable levels of antibodies with neutralizing activity, which can protect against infection in animal models1,2. Antibody levels decrease with time, but, to our knowledge, the nature and quality of the memory B~cells that would be required to produce antibodies upon reinfection has not been examined. Here we report on the humoral memory response in a cohort of 87~individuals assessed at 1.3 and 6.2~months after infection with SARS-CoV-2. We find that titres of IgM and IgG antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 decrease significantly over this time period, with IgA being less affected. Concurrently, neutralizing activity in plasma decreases by fivefold in pseudotype virus assays. By contrast, the number of RBD-specific memory B~cells remains unchanged at 6.2~months after infection. Memory B~cells display clonal turnover after 6.2~months, and the antibodies that they express have greater somatic hypermutation, resistance to RBD mutations and increased potency, indicative of continued evolution of the humoral response. Immunofluorescence and PCR analyses of intestinal biopsies obtained from asymptomatic individuals at 4~months after the onset of coronavirus disease~2019 (COVID-19) revealed the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids and immunoreactivity in the small bowel of 7 out of 14~individuals. We conclude that the memory B~cell response to SARS-CoV-2 evolves between 1.3 and 6.2~months after infection in a manner that is consistent with antigen persistence.},

  abstract = {Obejctives Serosurveys can be used to monitor COVID-19 seroprevalence and conduct surveillance. Dried blood spot~(DBS), used increasingly as a valuable sample to assay severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies (Ab), has several advantages, particularly in infants, due to the limited amount of blood~required and its utility in testing a large number of samples in a limited time-frame. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 IgG Ab prevalence in newborn DBS in the Trentino region of Italy, during the time period January 2020~\textendash{} December 2021. Methods Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels were determined in~DBS by means of Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac IgG ELISA assay (Euroimmun, Lubeck, Germany). Results Analyses included 2,400 DBS from newborns (54\% M, 46\% F), samples being collected 2\textendash 3~days after birth. The first DBS that tested positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was found in March 2020 and, up to May~2020, only 4 positive results were detected overall. Starting from June 2020, the positivity thresholds increased according to the epidemiological waves of the~COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, with a robust increment in the winters of~2020 and 2021. The percentage of positive DBS rose from~0 to 6\% to 10\textendash 47\%, in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrates DBS is a suitable tool for both epidemiological purposes and surveillance in~the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, particularly in newborns and~pregnant women, saving blood waste and sparing patients any discomfort.},

  abstract = {Serological assays capable of measuring antibody responses induced by previous infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been critical tools in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we use bead-based multiplex assays to measure IgG and IgA antibodies and IgG avidity to five SARS-CoV-2 antigens (Spike (S), receptor-binding domain (RBD), Nucleocapsid (N), S subunit 2, and Membrane-Envelope fusion (ME)). These assays were performed in several cohorts of healthcare workers and nursing home residents, who were followed for up to eleven months after SARS-CoV-2 infection or up to six months after vaccination. Our results show distinct kinetic patterns of antibody quantity (IgG and IgA) and avidity. While IgG and IgA antibody levels waned over time, with IgA antibody levels waning more rapidly, avidity increased with time after infection or vaccination. These contrasting kinetic patterns allow for the estimation of time since previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. Including avidity measurements in addition to antibody levels in a classification algorithm for estimating time since infection led to a substantial improvement in accuracy, from 62\% to 78\%. The inclusion of antibody avidity in panels of serological assays can yield valuable information for improving serosurveillance during SARS-CoV-2 epidemics.},

Bayesian inference is a natural way to propagate these uncertainties, with hierarchical modelling capturing variation in these parameters across experiments. Another concern is the people in the sample not being representative of the general population. Statistical adjustment cannot without strong assumptions correct for selection bias in an opt-in sample, but multilevel regression and post-stratification can at least adjust for known differences between the sample and the population. We demonstrate hierarchical regression and post-stratification models with code in Stan and discuss their application to a controversial recent study of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of people from the Stanford University area. Wide posterior intervals make it impossible to evaluate the quantitative claims of that study regarding the number of unreported infections. For future studies, the methods described here should facilitate more accurate estimates of disease prevalence from imperfect tests performed on non-representative samples.},

Thus, individuals who naturally contracted SARS-CoV-2 are expected to develop a more rapid and sustained response to COVID-19 vaccines than na\"ive individuals. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of the antibody response to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in six healthcare workers who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020, in comparison to nine control subjects without a previous infection. The vaccine was well tolerated by both groups, with no significant difference in the frequency of vaccine-associated side effects, with the exception of local pain, which was more common in previously infected subjects. Overall, the titers of neutralizing antibodies were markedly higher in response to the vaccine than after natural infection. In all subjects with pre-existing immunity, a rapid increase in anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibody titers was observed one week after the first dose, which seemed to act as a booster. Notably, in previously infected individuals, neutralizing antibody titers 7 days after the first vaccine dose were not significantly different from those observed in na\"ive subjects 7 days after the second vaccine dose. These results suggest that, in previously infected people, a single dose of the vaccine might be sufficient to induce an effective response.},

With over 50 million cases and 1.2 million deaths around the world, to date, this pandemic represents the gravest global health crisis of our times. Thus, the race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine is an urgent global imperative. At the time of writing, there are over 165 vaccine candidates being developed, with 33 in various stages of clinical testing. In this review, we discuss emerging insights about the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and their implications for vaccine design. We then review emerging knowledge of the immunogenicity of the numerous vaccine candidates that are currently being tested in the clinic and discuss the range of immune defense mechanisms that can be harnessed to develop novel vaccines that confer durable protection against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the potential role of a systems vaccinology approach in accelerating the clinical testing of vaccines, to meet the urgent needs posed by the pandemic.},

  abstract = {Background and aims SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays are relevant in managing the COVID-19 pandemic, providing valuable data on the immunization status of the population. However, current serology tests are highly variable, due to their different characteristics and to the lack of reference materials. The aim of the World Health Organization (WHO) first International Standard (IS) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin is to harmonize humoral immune response assessment after natural infection or vaccination, and recommend reporting the results for binding activity in Binding Antibody Units (BAU). Materials and methods This study analyzed six commercial quantitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 S-protein assays in a head-to-head comparison, using the manufacturers' conversion factors for the WHO IS to obtain BAU/mL values. Results Our data showed good alignment up to 1000 BAU/mL, then began to disperse, exhibiting some discrepancies. Moreover, correlations among methods varied with Cohen's Kappa ranging from 0.580 to 1.00, with the lowest agreement values for kits using different target antigens or different antibody isotypes, making it clear that the laboratory report should include this information. Values expressed as BAU/ml showed a reduced between-assays variability compared to AU/ml (median coefficients of variation 0.38 and 0.68, respectively; p~{$<~$}0.001). Conclusion On the basis of these data at present anti-SARS CoV-2 serological assays' results are not interchangeable, and, more importantly, individual immune monitoring should be performed with the same method.},

Methods We analyzed samples from 168 Japanese healthcare workers who had completed two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. We analyzed immunoglobulin G (IgG) index values against spike protein (SP) using automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system AIA-CL and analyzed the background factors affecting antibody titer.

Results The median SP IgG index values of the subjects (mean age~=~43 years; 75\% female) were 0.1, 1.35, 60.80, and 97.35 before and at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after the first dose, respectively. At 4 and 6 weeks after the first dose, SP IgG titers were found to have positive correlation with NT50 titer (r~=~0.7535 in 4 weeks; r~=~0.4376 in 6 weeks). Proportions of the SP IgG index values against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants compared with the original strain were 2.029, 0.544, 1.017, and 0.6096 respectively.

  abstract = {Predictive models of immune protection from COVID-19 are urgently needed to identify correlates of protection to assist in the future deployment of vaccines. To address this, we analyzed the relationship between in vitro neutralization levels and the observed protection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection using data from seven current vaccines and from convalescent cohorts. We estimated the neutralization level for 50\% protection against detectable SARS-CoV-2 infection to be 20.2\% of the mean convalescent level (95\% confidence interval (CI)\,=\,14.4\textendash 28.4\%). The estimated neutralization level required for 50\% protection from severe infection was significantly lower (3\% of the mean convalescent level; 95\% CI\,=\,0.7\textendash 13\%, P\,=\,0.0004). Modeling of the decay of the neutralization titer over the first 250\,d after immunization predicts that a significant loss in protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection will occur, although protection from severe disease should be largely retained. Neutralization titers against some SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern are reduced compared with the vaccine strain, and our model predicts the relationship between neutralization and efficacy against viral variants. Here, we show that neutralization level is highly predictive of immune protection, and provide an evidence-based model of SARS-CoV-2 immune protection that will assist in developing vaccine strategies to control the future trajectory of the pandemic.},

Results A combination test of NAT and serological testing for IgM antibody discovered 55.5\% of the total of 63 asymptomatic infections, which significantly raises the detection sensitivity when compared with the NAT alone (19\%). Serum proteome microarray analysis demonstrated that asymptomatics mainly produced IgM and IgG antibodies against S1 and N proteins out of 20 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Different from strong and persistent N-specific antibodies, S1-specific IgM responses, which evolved in asymptomatic individuals as early as the seventh day after exposure, peaked on days from 17 days to 25 days, and then disappeared in two months, might be used as an early diagnostic biomarker. 11.8\% (6/51) mild patients and 38.1\% (24/63) asymptomatic individuals did not produce neutralizing antibody. In particular, neutralizing antibody in asymptomatics gradually vanished in two months. Conclusion Our findings might have important implications for the definition of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections, diagnosis, serological survey, public health, and immunization strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Viral infections can cause significant morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF). The current Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic could therefore have a serious impact on the health of people with CF (pwCF). METHODS: We used the 38-country European Cystic Fibrosis Society Patient Registry (ECFSPR) to collect case data about pwCF and SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Up to 30 June 2020, 16 countries reported 130 SARS-CoV-2 cases in people with CF, yielding an incidence of 2.70/1000 pwCF. Incidence was higher in lung-transplanted patients (n=23) versus non-transplanted patients (n=107) (8.43 versus 2.36 cases/1000). Incidence was higher in pwCF versus the age-matched general population in the age groups {$<$}15, 15-24, and 25-49 years (p{$<$}0.001), with similar trends for pwCF with and without lung transplant. Compared to the general population, pwCF (regardless of transplantation status) had significantly higher rates of admission to hospital for all age groups with available data, and higher rates of intensive care, although not statistically significant. Most pwCF recovered (96.2\%), however 5 died, of whom 3 were lung transplant recipients. The case fatality rate for pwCF (3.85\%, 95\% CI: 1.26-8.75) was non-significantly lower than that of the general population (7.46\%; p=0.133). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in severe illness and death for pwCF, even for younger patients and especially for lung transplant recipients. PwCF should continue to shield from infection and should be prioritized for vaccination.},

While identification and containment of new cases remain important, laboratories must now pivot and consider an assessment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunity in the setting of the recent availability of multiple COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we have utilized the latest Abbott Alinity semiquantitative IgM and quantitative IgG spike protein (SP) serology assays (IgMSP and IgGSP) in combination with Abbott Alinity IgG nucleocapsid (NC) antibody test (IgGNC) to assess antibody responses in a cohort of 1,236 unique participants comprised of naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccinated (including both naive and recovered) individuals. The IgMSP and IgGSP assays were highly specific (100\%) with no cross-reactivity to archived samples collected prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, including those from individuals with seasonal coronavirus infections. Clinical sensitivity was 96\% after 15\,days for both IgMSP and IgGSP assays individually. When considered together, the sensitivity was 100\%. A combination of NC- and SP-specific serologic assays clearly differentiated naive, SARS-CoV-2-infected, and vaccine-related immune responses. Vaccination resulted in a significant increase in IgGSP and IgMSP values, with a major rise in IgGSP following the booster (second) dose in the naive group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2-recovered individuals had several-fold higher IgGSP responses than naive following the primary dose, with a comparatively dampened response following the booster. This work illustrates the strong clinical performance of these new serological assays and their utility in evaluating and distinguishing serological responses to infection and vaccination.},

Application was evaluated using samples from 57 patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, stratified according to disease severity. Specificity was assessed using historical samples from 200 blood donors. Results While IgM LFTs failed to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 37\textendash 84\% of non-hospitalised patients, the Wantai IgM ELISA detected antibodies in 79\%. The Euroimmun IgG ELISA detected antibodies in 95\% of non-hospitalised patients. IgA, IgM and IgG ELISA levels were initially low, increased over time, and correlated with disease severity. LFT sensitivity declined in samples taken {$>$}28 days after symptom onset/resolution. The Livzon IgG LFT had the highest specificity (98.5\%), followed by the Euroimmun IgG ELISA (96.2\%).

  abstract = {Background Serological surveys have been the gold standard to estimate numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the dynamics of the epidemic, and disease severity. Serological assays have decaying sensitivity with time that can bias their results, but there is a lack of guidelines to account for this phenomenon for SARS-CoV-2. Aim Our goal was to assess the sensitivity decay of seroassays for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infections, the dependence of this decay on assay characteristics, and to provide a simple method to correct for this phenomenon. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of SARS-CoV-2 serology studies. We included studies testing previously diagnosed, unvaccinated individuals, and excluded studies of cohorts highly unrepresentative of the general population (e.g. hospitalised patients). Results Of the 488 screened studies, 76 studies reporting on 50 different seroassays were included in the analysis. Sensitivity decay depended strongly on the antigen and the analytic technique used by the assay, with average sensitivities ranging between 26\% and 98\% at 6 months after infection, depending on assay characteristics. We found that a third of the included assays departed considerably from manufacturer specifications after 6 months. Conclusions Seroassay sensitivity decay depends on assay characteristics, and for some types of assays, it can make manufacturer specifications highly unreliable. We provide a tool to correct for this phenomenon and to assess the risk of decay for a given assay. Our analysis can guide the design and interpretation of serosurveys for SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens and quantify systematic biases in the existing serology literature.},

  abstract = {Reliable quantification of the antibody response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly relevant, e.g., for identifying possible vaccine failure and estimating the time of protection. Therefore, we evaluated five different anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays regarding the quantification of anti-spike (S) antibodies. Sera from 69 SARS-CoV-2-naive individuals 21 {$\pm$} 1\,days after vaccination with a single dose of BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) were tested using the following quantitative assays: Roche S total antibody, DiaSorin trimeric spike IgG, DiaSorin S1/S2 IgG, Abbott II IgG, and Serion/Virion IgG. Results were further compared to the percent inhibition calculated from a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). Individual values were distributed over several orders of magnitude for all assays. Although the assays were in good overall agreement ({$\rho$} = 0.80 to 0.94), Passing-Bablok regression revealed systematic constant and proportional differences, which could not be eliminated by converting the results to binding antibody units (BAU) per milliliter, as suggested by the manufacturers. Seven (10\%) individuals had negative sVNT results (i.e., {$<$}30\% inhibition). These samples were identified by most assays and yielded significantly lower binding antibody levels. Although all assays showed good correlation, they were not interchangeable, even when converted to BAU per milliliter using the WHO international standard for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin. This highlights the need for further standardization of SARS-CoV-2 serology. IMPORTANCE Reliable quantification of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is highly relevant, e.g., for identifying possible vaccine failure and estimating the time of protection. We compared the performance of five CE marked tests that quantify antibodies against the viral spike protein.

  abstract = {Seroprevalence surveys suggest that more than a third and possibly more than half of the global population has been infected with SARS-CoV-2 by early 2022. As large numbers of people continue to be infected, the efficacy and duration of natural immunity in terms of protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfections and severe disease is of crucial significance for the future. This narrative review provides an overview on epidemiological studies addressing this issue. National surveys covering 2020\textendash 2021 documented that a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with a significantly reduced risk of reinfections with efficacy lasting for at least one year and only relatively moderate waning immunity. Importantly, natural immunity showed roughly similar effect sizes regarding protection against reinfection across different SARS-CoV-2 variants, with the exception of the Omicron variant for which data are just emerging before final conclusions can be drawn. Risk of hospitalizations and deaths was also reduced in SARS-CoV-2 reinfections versus primary infections. Observational studies indicate that natural immunity may offer equal or greater protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections compared to individuals receiving two doses of an mRNA vaccine, but data are not fully consistent. The combination of a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and a respective vaccination, termed hybrid immunity, seems to confer the greatest protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections, but several knowledge gaps remain regarding this issue. Natural immunity should be considered for public health policy regarding SARS-CoV-2.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Seroprevalence surveys provide crucial information on cumulative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exposure. This Slovenian nationwide population study is the first longitudinal 6-month serosurvey using probability-based samples across all age categories. METHODS: Each participant supplied two blood samples: 1316 samples in April 2020 (first round) and 1211 in October/November 2020 (second round). The first-round sera were tested using Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA IgG (ELISA) and, because of uncertain estimates, were retested using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (Elecsys-N) and Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Elecsys-S). The second-round sera were concomitantly tested using Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S. RESULTS: The populations of both rounds matched the overall population (n~=~3000), with minor settlement type and age differences. The first-round seroprevalence corrected for the ELISA manufacturer's specificity was 2.78\% (95\% highest density interval [HDI] 1.81\%-3.80\%), corrected using pooled ELISA specificity calculated from published data 0.93\% (95\% CI 0.00\%-2.65\%), and based on Elecsys-N/Elecsys-S results 0.87\% (95\% HDI 0.40\%-1.38\%). The second-round unadjusted lower limit of seroprevalence on 11 November 2020 was 4.06\% (95\% HDI 2.97\%-5.16\%) and on 3 October 2020, unadjusted upper limit was 4.29\% (95\% HDI 3.18\%-5.47\%). CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Slovenia increased four-fold from late April to October/November 2020, mainly due to a devastating second wave. Significant logistic/methodological challenges accompanied both rounds. The main lessons learned were a need for caution when relying on manufacturer-generated assay evaluation data, the importance of multiple manufacturer-independent assay performance assessments, the need for concomitant use of highly-specific serological assays targeting different SARS-CoV-2 proteins in serosurveys conducted in low-prevalence settings or during epidemic exponential growth and the usefulness of a Bayesian approach for overcoming complex methodological challenges.},

  abstract = {Background:. The COVID-19 situation in Brazil is complex due to large differences in the shape and size of regional epidemics. Understanding these patterns is crucial to understand future outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or other respiratory pathogens in the country. Methods:. We tested 97,950 blood donation samples for IgG antibodies from March 2020 to March 2021 in 8 of Brazil's most populous cities. Residential postal codes were used to obtain representative samples. Weekly age- and sex-specific seroprevalence were estimated by correcting the crude seroprevalence by test sensitivity, specificity, and antibody waning. Results:. The inferred attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2020, before the Gamma variant of concern (VOC) was dominant, ranged from 19.3\% (95\% credible interval [CrI] 17.5\textendash 21.2\%) in Curitiba to 75.0\% (95\% CrI 70.8\textendash 80.3\%) in Manaus. Seroprevalence was consistently smaller in women and donors older than 55 years. The age-specific infection fatality rate (IFR) differed between cities and consistently increased with age. The infection hospitalisation rate increased significantly during the Gamma-dominated second wave in Manaus, suggesting increased morbidity of the Gamma VOC compared to previous variants circulating in Manaus. The higher disease penetrance associated with the health system's collapse increased the overall IFR by a minimum factor of 2.91 (95\% CrI 2.43\textendash 3.53). Conclusions:. These results highlight the utility of blood donor serosurveillance to track epidemic maturity and demonstrate demographic and spatial heterogeneity in SARS-CoV-2 spread. Funding:.

  abstract = {Background The Abbott Laboratories SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the DiaSorin LIASON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay are both chemiluminescent immunoassays that qualitatively detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The Abbott assay detects IgG against the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the DiaSorin assay uses antigen derived from the viral spike (S) protein. Here we evaluate the performance of these two assays at our institution. Methods 45 patient samples (serum or plasma) were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by both the Abbott and DiaSorin assays. The samples were previously characterized at a national reference laboratory using the Abbott assay or by an in-house PCR-based test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Samples yielding discordant results across platforms were further tested using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay at the reference laboratory. Results 22 samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by the reference lab Abbott assay, and 23 tested positive by the same reference lab test (n = 13) or by an in-house PCR-based test (n = 10). The 22 samples characterized as negative again tested negative by both the Abbott (in-house) and DiaSorin assays (100\% NPA). Among the 23 samples characterized as positive, all 23 tested positive by the Abbott assay (100\% PPA), while only 15 tested positive by the DiaSorin assay (65\% PPA). For each of the 8 discordant cases, samples were further tested by EUROIMMUN assay, which targets the S protein; 7 of the 8 samples tested negative by this assay, in agreement with the DiaSorin test results. Thus, for the discordant cases, testing for IgG against N (in-house and reference lab Abbott assays) gave positive results, while testing for IgG against S (DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays) mostly gave negative results. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of the differences between various SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, and providers should be aware of the specific antigenic target(s) in each test. Selection of a specific assay may depend on the need to assess past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (for which a nucleocapsid target may be more sensitive) or to detect neutralizing antibodies (for which a spike target may be more relevant). This also has implications for disease surveillance as reliance on anti-spike antibodies alone may underestimate infection prevalence. Disclosures All Authors: No reported disclosures},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Assessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic. METHODS: The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Sant\'e study and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study. FINDINGS: Between April 6 and May 9, 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the first week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 2{$\cdot$}4-8{$\cdot$}0},
  n = {341). The estimate increased to 8{$\cdot$}5\% (5{$\cdot$}9-11{$\cdot$}4},

This study focused on a quantitative correlation between different commercial assays and a neutralization test (NT). Comparative data is needed as a basis for the production of convalescent plasma and potential interpretations COVID-19 immunity. Sera of 100 SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma donors were collected and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were characterized using three different IgG-ELISAs (EUROIMMUN IgG and NCP-IgG ELISA, Wantai ELISA), two CLIA (Elecsys, LIAISON) and two lateral flow tests (MEDsan IgM/IgG-Rapid-Test, Wantai Rapid Test) and subsequently correlated to neutralization titers. The Wantai ELISA and the Elecsys provide the highest sensitivities in this sample (98 and 95 percent respectively). Titers with the best overall quantitative correlation to the NT titer were obtained with the Euroimmun IgG ELISA assay (Rho=0.759) and the Wantai ELISA assay (Rho=0.729). An infection without fever and negative or weakly positive reactions in the Wantai Rapid test were negative predictive factors for NT titers {$>$}1:200 (negative predictive value of 92 \% and 92 \% respectively, combination of both 100 \%). The Wantai ELISA titer could be a suitable substitute for NT. An adequate pooling strategy of plasma units additionally could compensate deviations of individual antibody titers.},

The World Health Organization (WHO) has created an international standard to allow harmonization of immune response assessment to an arbitrary unit across different commercial assays; however, the accuracy of reporting of SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody titers in international standard units (BAU or IU/mL) from commercial assays is not well studied. Here, we report the performance comparison of four quantitative commercial assays testing for SARS-CoV-2 spike immunoglobins using the WHO's international standard. Sera, EDTA-plasma and heparinized plasma collected from individuals who are vaccine na\"ive or received BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech), mRNA-1273 (Moderna) or ChAdOx1-S (Oxford-AstraZeneca) were tested using Abbott Architect AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II, DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG, Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S and GenScript cPass SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization assays. The sensitivities ranged from 90\% to 100\%, and specificities from 88\% to 100\%. These four assays had excellent agreement (0.79\textendash 0.93) and correlation (0.87\textendash 0.97); however, Passing-Bablok regression analysis indicated that data generated by these assays were not comparable. Our data suggests that natural SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited a greater antibody response compared to vaccines, evident by a significantly higher neutralizing antibody titer in unvaccinated individuals who seroconverted.},
