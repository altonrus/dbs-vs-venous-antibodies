  abstract = {Objective. To examine the factors associated with the first use of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic using Andersen's Model of Healthcare Utilization. Andersen's Model of Healthcare Utilization allowed the categorization of the independent variables into the following: (1) predisposing factors, including sociodemographic variables and health beliefs; (2) enabling factors, including socioeconomic status and access to care; and (3) need for care, including preexisting or newly diagnosed conditions and reasons to seek out care or to utilize a new mode of care. Methods. Potential respondents (n=4,077) were identified for recruitment from a volunteer registry in Arkansas. Recruitment emails provided a study description, the opportunity to verify meeting the study's inclusion criteria and to consent for participation, and a link to follow to complete the survey online. The online survey responses were collected between July and August of 2020 (n=1,137). Results. Telehealth utilization included two categories: (1) utilizers reported the first use of telehealth services during the pandemic, and (2) nonutilizers reported they had never used telehealth. Lower odds of reporting telehealth utilization during the pandemic were associated with race (Black; OR=0.57, CI [0.33, 0.96]) and education (high School or less; OR=0.45, CI [0.25, 0.83]). Higher odds of reporting telehealth utilization included having more than one provider (OR=2.33, CI [1.30, 4.18]), more physical (OR=1.12, CI [1.00, 1.25]) and mental (OR 1.53, CI [1.24, 1.88]) health conditions, and changes in healthcare delivery during the pandemic (OR=3.49, CI [2.78, 4.38]). Conclusions. The results illustrate that disparities exist in Arkansans' utilization of telehealth services during the pandemic. Future research should explore the disparities in telehealth utilization and how telehealth may be used to address disparities in care for Black Arkansans and those with low socioeconomic status.},

  abstract = {Background Many studies report the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. We aimed to synthesize seroprevalence data to better estimate the level and distribution of SARS-CoV-2 infection, identify high-risk groups, and inform public health decision making. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched publication databases, preprint servers, and grey literature sources for seroepidemiological study reports, from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We included studies that reported a sample size, study date, location, and seroprevalence estimate. We corrected estimates for imperfect test accuracy with Bayesian measurement error models, conducted meta-analysis to identify demographic differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and meta-regression to identify study-level factors associated with seroprevalence. We compared region-specific seroprevalence data to confirmed cumulative incidence. PROSPERO: CRD42020183634. Results We identified 968 seroprevalence studies including 9.3 million participants in 74 countries. There were 472 studies (49\%) at low or moderate risk of bias. Seroprevalence was low in the general population (median 4.5\%, IQR 2.4\textendash 8.4\%); however, it varied widely in specific populations from low (0.6\% perinatal) to high (59\% persons in assisted living and long-term care facilities). Median seroprevalence also varied by Global Burden of Disease region, from 0.6\% in Southeast Asia, East Asia and Oceania to 19.5\% in Sub-Saharan Africa (p{$<$}0.001). National studies had lower seroprevalence estimates than regional and local studies (p{$<$}0.001). Compared to Caucasian persons, Black persons (prevalence ratio [RR] 3.37, 95\% CI 2.64\textendash 4.29), Asian persons (RR 2.47, 95\% CI 1.96\textendash 3.11), Indigenous persons (RR 5.47, 95\% CI 1.01\textendash 32.6), and multi-racial persons (RR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.60\textendash 2.24) were more likely to be seropositive. Seroprevalence was higher among people ages 18\textendash 64 compared to 65 and over (RR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.11\textendash 1.45). Health care workers in contact with infected persons had a 2.10 times (95\% CI 1.28\textendash 3.44) higher risk compared to health care workers without known contact. There was no difference in seroprevalence between sex groups. Seroprevalence estimates from national studies were a median 18.1 times (IQR 5.9\textendash 38.7) higher than the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence, but there was large variation between Global Burden of Disease regions from 6.7 in South Asia to 602.5 in Sub-Saharan Africa. Notable methodological limitations of serosurveys included absent reporting of test information, no statistical correction for demographics or test sensitivity and specificity, use of non-probability sampling and use of non-representative sample frames. Discussion Most of the population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Public health measures must be improved to protect disproportionately affected groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, until vaccine-derived herd immunity is achieved. Improvements in serosurvey design and reporting are needed for ongoing monitoring of infection prevalence and the pandemic response.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Telemedicine is increasingly being offered to patients for rheumatology care, but few studies have examined factors associated with telemedicine use or outcomes of telemedicine in rheumatology. The objective of this analysis was to determine factors associated with the use of video telemedicine when offered as part of usual care for follow-up of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Individuals in the Alaska Tribal Health System with a diagnosis of RA were recruited when seeing a rheumatologist either in-person or by video telemedicine, both of which were offered as part of usual care. At the study visit, participants completed the Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) and a telemedicine perception survey and agreed to a medical record review for demographics and disease characteristics. Data from this visit were analyzed to determine factors associated with using telemedicine for RA, compared to being seen in-person only. RESULTS: Of 122 participants enrolled in the study, 56 (46\%) had been seen by telemedicine at least once. Factors associated with telemedicine use in univariate analysis included a higher RAPID3 score, a higher number of rheumatologist visits in the preceding year, more positive perceptions of telemedicine, and seeing a physician who used telemedicine more often. On multivariate analysis, these 4 factors all remained significant. Demographic and other disease-related factors or comorbidities were not associated with telemedicine use. CONCLUSION: When offered as an option for rheumatology care, video telemedicine was more likely to be used by RA patients with higher disease activity and more positive perceptions of telemedicine, and by patients whose physicians used telemedicine more often.},

  abstract = {Background High-throughput sequencing has enabled detailed insights into complex microbial environments, including the human gut microbiota. The accuracy of the sequencing data however, is reliant upon appropriate storage of the samples prior to DNA extraction. The aim of this study was to conduct the first MiSeq sequencing investigation into the effects of faecal storage on the microbiota, compared to fresh samples. Culture-based analysis was also completed. Methods Seven faecal samples were collected from healthy adults. Samples were separated into fresh (DNA extracted immediately), snap frozen on dry ice and frozen for 7 days at -80\textdegree C prior to DNA extraction or samples frozen at -80\textdegree C for 7 days before DNA extraction. Sequencing was completed on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Culturing of total aerobes, anaerobes and bifidobacteria was also completed. Results No significant differences at phylum or family levels between the treatment groups occurred. At genus level only Faecalibacterium and Leuconostoc were significantly different in the fresh samples compared to the snap frozen group (p = 0.0298; p = 0.0330 respectively). Diversity analysis indicated that samples clustered based on the individual donor, rather than by storage group. No significant differences occurred in the culture-based analysis between the fresh, snap or -80\textdegree C frozen samples. Conclusions Using the MiSeq platform coupled with culture-based analysis, this study highlighted that limited significant changes in microbiota occur following rapid freezing of faecal samples prior to DNA extraction. Thus, rapid freezing of samples prior to DNA extraction and culturing, preserves the integrity of the microbiota.},

The article formally shows the inherent connections among the MMW-S method, propensity score stratification, and inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW). Both MMW-S and IPTW are suitable for evaluating multiple concurrent treatments, and hence have broader applications than matching, stratification, or covariance adjustment for the propensity score. Furthermore, mathematical consideration and a series of simulations reveal that the MMW-S method has incorporated some important strengths of the propensity score stratification method, which generally enhance the robustness of MMW-S estimates in comparison with IPTW estimates. To illustrate, the author applies the MMW-S method to evaluations of within-class homogeneous grouping in early elementary reading instruction.},

  abstract = {Background: Disparities in telemedicine use by race, age, and income have been consistently documented. To date, research has focused on telemedicine use among patients with adequate insurance coverage. To address this gap, this study identifies patient-level factors associated with telemedicine use during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among one free clinic network's patients who are underinsured or uninsured. Methods: Electronic health record data were reviewed for patient-level data on patients seen from March 2020 to September 2020. Patients were grouped by telemedicine use history. We controlled for sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, race/ethnicity) and comorbidities. Logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Across 198 adult patients, 56.6\% received telemedicine care. Of these, 99.1\% elected for audio-only telemedicine instead of video telemedicine. Telemedicine use was more likely among those living within 15 miles of their clinic (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]\,=\,4.43, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-11.53). It was less likely to be used by older patients (aOR\,=\,0.97, 95\% CI 0.94-1.00), patients of male sex (aOR\,=\,0.85, 95\% CI 0.18-0.92), and those establishing care as a new patient (aOR\,=\,0.01, 95\% CI 0.00-0.07). Conclusion: The moderate usage of telemedicine suggests that its implementation in free clinics may be feasible. Solutions specific to patients with smartphone-only internet access are needed to improve the use of video telemedicine as smartphone-specific factors (e.g., data use limits) may influence the ability for underserved patients to receive video telemedicine.},

  abstract = {Background: The prevalence of infection in Canada's COVID-19 viral waves, the predictors of infection, and the durability of antibody responses to infection remain undocumented.Methods: We organized serial online surveys of a representative group of Canadian adults about their COVID experience in the first (n=19 994; April-July 2020) and second viral wave (n=14 621; October 2020-March 2021). We paired these with IgG analysis of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in self-collected dried blood spots after the first (n=8967) and second (n=7102) waves.Findings: Canada's cumulative seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among unvaccinated adults rose from \textasciitilde 2\% after the first wave to 7\% after the second. The seropositivity pattern was heterogeneous demographically and geographically during the first wave, but more homogeneous by the second (except in the four Atlantic Provinces, cumulative seroprevalence \textasciitilde 3\%). Seroprevalence among visible minorities rose sharply from about 2\% to {$>$}8\% from the first to second wave. About a quarter of those reporting COVID symptoms during the second wave were seropositive, and in both waves the odds ratio (OR) of seropositivity for COVID symptoms exceeded six. About one-fifth of seropositives reported no symptoms. Of 134 seropositive adults in the first wave who were retested after the second, 83\% (111) remained seropositive at least seven months later. Current smokers and people with a history of diabetes had lower ORs of infection. We calculated the absolute numbers of seropositive adults nationwide, which nearly quadrupled from 0.57 million to 1.90 million, with the largest increases among older adults. Infection fatality rates fell from 3.7 to 2.6/1000 infections, most notably at older ages.Interpretation: Canada's COVID pandemic grew substantially between the first and second viral waves. Home-based DBS collection offers a practicable way to document evolving demographic and geographic patterns and to assess the levels and durability of population immunity, including from SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.Funding: Pfizer Global Medical, Unity Health Foundation, and the Canadian COVID-19 Immunity Task Force. Declaration of Interest: None to declare. Ethical Approval: The Ab-C study was approved by the Unity Health Toronto Ethics Review Board.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore whether racial/ethnic differences in telehealth use existed during the peak pandemic period among NYC patients seeking care for COVID-19 related symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used data from a large health system in NYC - the epicenter of the US crisis - to describe characteristics of patients seeking COVID-related care via telehealth, ER, or office encounters during the peak pandemic period. Using multinomial logistic regression, we estimated the magnitude of the relationship between patient characteristics and the odds of having a first encounter via telehealth versus ER or office visit, and then used regression parameter estimates to predict patients' probabilities of using different encounter types given their characteristics. RESULTS: Demographic factors, including race/ethnicity and age, were significantly predictive of telehealth use. As compared to Whites, Blacks had higher adjusted odds of using both the ER versus telehealth (OR: 4.3, 95\% CI: 4.0-4.6) and office visits versus telehealth (OR: 1.4, 95\% CI: 1.3-1.5). For Hispanics versus Whites, the analogous ORs were 2.5 (95\% CI: 2.3-2.7) and 1.2 (95\% CI: 1.1-1.3). Compared to any age groups, patients 65+ had significantly higher odds of using either ER or office visits versus telehealth. CONCLUSIONS: The response to COVID-19 has involved an unprecedented expansion in telehealth. While older Americans and minority populations among others are known to be disadvantaged by the digital divide, few studies have examined disparities in telehealth specifically, and none during COVID-19. Additional research into sociodemographic heterogeneity in telehealth use is needed to prevent potentially further exacerbating health disparities overall.},
