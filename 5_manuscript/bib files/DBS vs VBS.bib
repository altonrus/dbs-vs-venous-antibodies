  abstract = {Background: There is mounting evidence that the third wave of COVID-19 incidence is declining, yet variants of concern (VOCs) continue to present public health challenges in Canada. The emergence of VOCs has sparked debate on how to effectively control their impacts on the Canadian population. Objective: Provincial and territorial governments have implemented a wide range of policy measures to protect residents against community transmission of COVID-19, but research examining the specific impact of policy countermeasures on the VOCs in Canada is needed. Our study objective was to identify provinces with disproportionate prevalence of VOCs relative to COVID-19 mitigation efforts in provinces and territories in Canada. Methods: We analyzed publicly available provincial- and territorial-level data on the prevalence of VOCs in relation to mitigating factors, summarized in 3 measures: (1) strength of public health countermeasures (stringency index), (2) the extent to which people moved about outside their homes (mobility index), and (3) the proportion of the provincial or territorial population that was fully vaccinated (vaccine uptake). Using spatial agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (unsupervised machine learning), provinces and territories were grouped into clusters by stringency index, mobility index, and full vaccine uptake. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the prevalence of VOCs (Alpha, or B.1.1.7; Beta, or B.1.351; Gamma, or P.1; and Delta, or B.1.617.2 variants) across the clusters. Results: We identified 3 clusters of vaccine uptake and countermeasures. Cluster 1 consisted of the 3 Canadian territories and was characterized by a higher degree of vaccine deployment and fewer countermeasures. Cluster 2 (located in Central Canada and the Atlantic region) was typified by lower levels of vaccine deployment and moderate countermeasures. The third cluster, which consisted of provinces in the Pacific region, Central Canada, and the Prairies, exhibited moderate vaccine deployment but stronger countermeasures. The overall and variant-specific prevalences were significantly different across the clusters. Conclusions: This ``up to the point'' analysis found that implementation of COVID-19 public health measures, including the mass vaccination of populations, is key to controlling VOC prevalence rates in Canada. As of June 15, 2021, the third wave of COVID-19 in Canada is declining, and those provinces and territories that had implemented more comprehensive public health measures showed lower VOC prevalence. Public health authorities and governments need to continue to communicate the importance of sociobehavioural preventive measures, even as populations in Canada continue to receive their primary and booster doses of vaccines.},

DBS collection could be used to facilitate widespread testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to document past infection, vaccination, and potentially immunity. We investigated the characteristics of Roche's Anti-SARS-CoV-2 (S) assay, a quantitative commercial assay for antibodies against the spike glycoprotein. Antibody levels were reduced relative to plasma following elution from DBS. Quantitative results from DBS samples were highly correlated with values from plasma (r2 = 0.98), allowing for extrapolation using DBS results to accurately estimate plasma antibody levels. High concordance between plasma and fingerpick DBS was observed in PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients tested 90 days or more after the diagnosis (45/46 matched; 1/46 mismatched plasma vs. DBS). The assessment of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 using DBS may be feasible using a quantitative anti-S assay, although false negatives may rarely occur in those with very low antibody levels.},

  abstract = {The implementation and evaluation of malaria control programs would be greatly facilitated by new tools for the rapid assessment of malaria transmission intensity. Because acquisition and maintenance of antimalarial antibodies depend on exposure to malaria infection, such antibodies might be used as proxy measures of transmission intensity. We have compared the prevalence of IgG antibodies with three Plasmodium falciparum asexual stage antigens in individuals of all ages living at varying altitudes encompassing a range of transmission intensities from hyper- to hypoendemic in northeastern Tanzania, with alternative measures of transmission intensity. The prevalence of antibodies to merozoite surface protein-1(19) was significantly more closely correlated with altitude than either point-prevalence malaria parasitemia or single measures of hemoglobin concentration. Analysis of age-specific seroprevalence rates enabled differentiation of recent (seasonal) changes in transmission intensity from longer-term transmission trends and, using a mathematical model of the annual rate of seroconversion, estimation of the longevity of the antibody response. Thus, serological tools allow us to detect variations in malaria transmission over time. Such tools will be invaluable for monitoring trends in malaria endemicity and the effectiveness of malaria control programs.},

Using the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker indicators and aggregate stringency indices, this paper explores variation in the timing and relative stringency of government responses across 13 Canadian provinces and territories. Canada is a decentralized federation where provinces and territories develop policies to fit local epidemiological and political contexts. The authors find that many smaller, less populous provinces and territories created the conditions for greater freedom of movement and `normalcy' as compared to larger provinces. With the creation of regional zones and tiered policy triggers, most regions have adopted reactive policies and restrictions, often too late, and not without unintended confusion. To date, the authors find that the benefits of federalism have been unevenly leveraged, a lack of coordination in planning and communication between the provinces and territories is an area of opportunity for improved future pandemic planning.},

  abstract = {Background The gold standard for respiratory virus testing is a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, which is collected by a healthcare worker. Midturbinate (MT) swabs are an alternative due to their ease of collection and possible self-collection by patients. The objective of this study was to compare the respiratory virus isolation of flocked MT swabs compared to flocked NP swabs. Methods Beginning in October 2008, healthy adults aged 18 to 69 years were recruited into a cohort and followed up for symptoms of influenza. They were asked to have NP and MT swabs taken as soon as possible after the onset of a fever or two or more respiratory symptoms with an acute onset. The swabs were tested for viral respiratory infections using Seeplex{\textregistered} RV12 multiplex PCR detection kit. Seventy six pairs of simultaneous NP and MT swabs were collected from 38 symptomatic subjects. Twenty nine (38\%) of these pairs were positive by either NP or MT swabs or both. Sixty nine (91\%) of the pair results were concordant. Two samples (3\%) for hCV OC43/HKU1 and 1 sample (1\%) for rhinovirus A/B were positive by NP but negative by MT. One sample each for hCV 229E/NL63, hCV OC43/HKU1, respiratory syncytial virus A, and influenza B were positive by MT but negative by NP. Conclusions Flocked MT swabs are sensitive for the diagnosis of multiple respiratory viruses. Given the ease of MT collection and similar results between the two swabs, it is likely that MT swabs should be the preferred method of respiratory cell collection for outpatient studies. In light of this data, larger studies should be performed to ensure that this still holds true and data should also be collected on the patient preference of collection methods.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Serological testing is needed to investigate the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from front-line essential workers to their household members. However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of finger stick capillary whole blood, collected in the home and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). We describe assay performance and demonstrate its utility for remote sampling with results from a community-based study. METHODS: An ELISA to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized to quantify IgG antibodies in DBS. Samples were self-collected from a community sample of 232 participants enriched with health care workers, including 30 known COVID-19 cases and their household members. RESULTS: Among 30 individuals sharing a household with a virus-confirmed case of COVID-19, 80\% were seropositive. Of 202 community individuals without prior confirmed acute COVID-19 diagnoses, 36\% were seropositive. Of documented convalescent COVID-19 cases from the community, 29 of 30 (97\%) were seropositive for IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain. CONCLUSION: DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection. Early analysis suggests a high rate of transmission among household members. High rates of seroconversion were also noted following recovery from infection. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples can facilitate seroprevalence assessment in community settings to address epidemiological questions, monitor duration of antibody responses, and assess if antibodies against the spike protein correlate with protection from reinfection.},

  abstract = {In the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, testing for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is paramount for monitoring immune responses in postauthorization vaccination and seroepidemiological studies. However, large-scale and iterative serological testing by venipuncture in older persons can be challenging. Capillary blood sampling using a finger prick and collection on protein saver cards, i.e., dried blood spots (DBSs), has already proven to be a promising alternative. However, elderly persons have reduced cutaneous microvasculature, which may affect DBS-based antibody testing. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the performance of DBS tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among nursing homes residents. We collected paired venous blood and DBS samples on two types of protein saver cards (Whatman and EUROIMMUN) from nursing home residents, as well as from staff members as a reference population. Venous blood samples were analyzed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using the Abbott chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA). DBS samples were analyzed by the EUROIMMUN enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies. We performed a statistical assessment to optimize the ELISA cutoff value for the DBS testing using Youden's J index. A total of 273 paired DBS-serum samples were analyzed, of which 129 were positive, as assessed by the reference test. The sensitivities and specificities of DBS testing ranged from 95.0\% to 97.1\% and from 97.1\% to 98.8\%, respectively, depending on the population (residents or staff members) and the DBS card type. Therefore, we found that DBS sampling is a valid alternative to venipuncture for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among elderly subjects., IMPORTANCE Since the implementation of newly developed SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the general population, serological tests are of increasing importance. Because DBS samples can be obtained with a finger prick and can be shipped and stored at room temperature, they are optimal for use in large-scale SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance or postauthorization vaccination studies, even in an elderly study population.},

The study aimed to compare antibody detection in DBS eluates using the Roche Elecsys {\textregistered} immunoassay with antibody detection in paired plasma samples, using the same assay. The study was in one Police and one Fire \& Rescue facility in England; it comprised of 195 participants within a larger sample COVID-19 serodiagnostics study of keyworkers, EDSAB-HOME. Outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of DBS (the index test) relative to plasma (the reference test), at an experimental cut-off; quality of DBS sample collected; estimates of relative sensitivity of DBS vs. plasma immunoassay in a larger population. 18/195 (9.2\%) participants tested positive using plasma samples. DBS sample quality varied markedly by phlebotomist, and low sample volume significantly reduced immunoassay signals. Using an experimental cut-off, sensitivity and specificity of DBS were 89.0\% (95\% CI 67.2, 96.9\%) and 100.0\% (95\% CI 97.9, 100\%) respectively compared with using plasma. The limit of detection for DBS is about 30 times higher than for plasma. DBS use for SARS-CoV-2 serology, though feasible, is insensitive relative to immunoassays on plasma.

We quantified and compared anti-spike (S) antibodies using different commercial immunoassays. We tested serum samples from 70 SARS-CoV-2-naive health care workers 2 weeks after vaccination with a single dose of BNT162b2, 2 and 4 weeks, and 3 months after the second dose of BNT162b2. The following quantitative assays were used: Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche-S), Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant [Abbott-IgG(S)], and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgM (Abbott-IgM). All samples tested positive for Roche-S and Abbott-IgG antibodies after the second dose, with 83.6\% Abbott-IgM positive rate. Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) correlated significantly in all samples (r~=~0.920, p~{$<~$}0.0001), and the Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) assay showed a strong correlation with each other at each time point after vaccination. Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers were correlated with age; their rate of decline was age-dependent in males but not in females. Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers decreased from 2 weeks after the second dose. Roche-S antibody titers peaked 2 weeks after the second dose in 76.2\% of the participants; the titers recovered 3 months post-vaccination after declining at week 4 in 40.7\% of the participants. The concordance between Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers over time was 47.5\%. Most participants presented significantly high Roche-S and Abbott-IgG(S) antibody titers after immunization. Some measurements were inconsistent with titer changes between these assays, possibly because of differences in the immunoglobulin-specificity of the kits.},

  abstract = {We investigate the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of finger prick capillary dried blood spot (DBS) samples tested by a quantitative multiplex anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG) assay to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies after infection or vaccination. This cross-sectional study involved participants (n\,=\,6,841) from several serological surveys conducted in nonhospitalized children and adults throughout 2020 and 2021 in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Analysis used paired DBS and serum samples from a subset of participants (n\,=\,642) prior to vaccination to establish signal thresholds and calculate diagnostic accuracy by logistic regression. Discrimination of the logistic regression model was assessed by receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis in an n\,=\,2,000 bootstrap of the paired sample (n\,=\,642). The model was cross-validated in a subset of vaccinated persons (n\,=\,90). Unpaired DBS samples (n\,=\,6,723) were used to evaluate anti-IgG signal distributions. In comparison to paired serum, DBS samples from an unvaccinated population possessed a sensitivity of 79\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 58 to 91\%) and specificity of 97\% (95\% CI: 95 to 98\%). ROC analysis found that DBS samples accurately classify SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion at an 88\% percent rate (area under the curve [AUC] = 88\% [95\% CI: 80 to 95\%]). In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine dose one or two recipients, the sensitivity of DBS testing increased to 97\% (95\% CI: 83 to 99\%) and 100\% (95\% CI: 88 to 100\%). Modeling found that DBS testing possesses a high positive predictive value (98\% [95\% CI: 97 to 98\%]) in a population with 75\% seroprevalence. We demonstrate that DBS testing should be considered to reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity from natural infection or vaccination. IMPORTANCE Dried blood spot samples have comparable diagnostic accuracy to serum collected by venipuncture when tested by an electrochemiluminescent assay for antibodies and should be considered to reliably detect seropositivity following SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination.},

  abstract = {Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) seroprevalence studies bridge the gap left from case detection, to estimate the true burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. While multiple anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays are available, no gold standard exists. Methods This serial cross-sectional study was conducted using plasma samples from 8999 healthy blood donors between April-September 2020. Each sample was tested by four assays: Abbott SARS-Cov-2 IgG assay, targeting nucleocapsid (Abbott-NP) and three in-house IgG ELISA assays (targeting spike glycoprotein, receptor binding domain, and nucleocapsid). Seroprevalence rates were compared using multiple composite reference standards and by a series of Bayesian Latent Class Models. Result We found 13 unique diagnostic phenotypes; only 32 samples (0.4\%) were positive by all assays. None of the individual assays resulted in seroprevalence increasing monotonically over time. In contrast, by using the results from all assays, the Bayesian Latent Class Model with informative priors predicted seroprevalence increased from 0.7\% (95\% credible interval (95\% CrI); 0.4, 1.0\%) in April/May to 0.7\% (95\% CrI 0.5, 1.1\%) in June/July to 0.9\% (95\% CrI 0.5, 1.3) in August/September. Assay characteristics varied over time. Overall Spike had the highest sensitivity (93.5\% (95\% CrI 88.7, 97.3\%), while the sensitivity of the Abbott-NP assay waned from 77.3\% (95\% CrI 58.7, 92.5\%) in April/May to 64.4\% (95\% CrI 45.6, 83.0) by August/September. Discussion Our results confirmed very low seroprevalence after the first wave in Canada. Given the dynamic nature of this pandemic, Bayesian Latent Class Models can be used to correct for imperfect test characteristics and waning IgG antibody signals.},

  abstract = {The Abbott Laboratories SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and the DiaSorin LIASON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay are both chemiluminescent immunoassays that qualitatively detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The Abbott assay detects IgG against the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, while the DiaSorin assay uses antigen derived from the viral spike (S) protein. Here we evaluate the performance of these two assays at our institution.45 patient samples (serum or plasma) were tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG by both the Abbott and DiaSorin assays. The samples were previously characterized at a national reference laboratory using the Abbott assay or by an in-house PCR-based test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Samples yielding discordant results across platforms were further tested using the EUROIMMUN Anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (IgG) assay at the reference laboratory.22 samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by the reference lab Abbott assay, and 23 tested positive by the same reference lab test (n = 13) or by an in-house PCR-based test (n = 10). The 22 samples characterized as negative again tested negative by both the Abbott (in-house) and DiaSorin assays (100\% NPA). Among the 23 samples characterized as positive, all 23 tested positive by the Abbott assay (100\% PPA), while only 15 tested positive by the DiaSorin assay (65\% PPA). For each of the 8 discordant cases, samples were further tested by EUROIMMUN assay, which targets the S protein; 7 of the 8 samples tested negative by this assay, in agreement with the DiaSorin test results. Thus, for the discordant cases, testing for IgG against N (in-house and reference lab Abbott assays) gave positive results, while testing for IgG against S (DiaSorin and EUROIMMUN assays) mostly gave negative results.These findings highlight the importance of the differences between various SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests, and providers should be aware of the specific antigenic target(s) in each test. Selection of a specific assay may depend on the need to assess past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (for which a nucleocapsid target may be more sensitive) or to detect neutralizing antibodies (for which a spike target may be more relevant). This also has implications for disease surveillance as reliance on anti-spike antibodies alone may underestimate infection prevalence.All Authors: No reported disclosures},

  abstract = {We have previously used composite reference standards and latent class analysis (LCA) to evaluate the performance of laboratory assays in the presence of tarnished gold standards. Here, we apply these techniques to repeated, cross-sectional study of Canadian blood donors, whose sera underwent parallel testing with four separate SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. We designed a repeated cross-sectional design with random cross-sectional sampling of all available retention samples (n\,=\,1500/month) for a 12 -month period from April 2020 until March 2021. Each sample was evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using four assays an Abbott Architect assay targeting the nucleocapsid antigen (Abbott-NP, Abbott, Chicago IL) and three in-house IgG ELISAs recognizing distinct recombinant viral antigens: full-length spike glycoprotein (Spike), spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (NP). We used two analytic approaches to estimate SAR-CoV-2 seroprevalence: a composite reference standard and LCA. Using LCA to estimate true seropositivity status based on the results of the four antibody tests, we estimated that seroprevalence increased from 0.8\% (95\% CI: 0.5--1.4\%) in April 2020 to 6.3\% (95\% CI: 5.1--7.6\%) in March 2021. Our study provides further support for the use of LCA in upcoming public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics when a gold standard assay may not be available or identifiable. IMPORTANCE Here, we describe an approach to estimating seroprevalence in a low prevalence setting when multiple assays are available and yet no known gold standard exists. Because serological studies identify cases through both diagnostic testing and surveillance, and otherwise silent, unrecognized infections, serological data can be used to estimate the true infection fatality ratio of a disease. However, seroprevalence studies rely on assays with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Seroreversion (loss of antibody response) also occurs over time, and with the advent of vaccination, distinction of antibody response resulting from vaccination as opposed to antibody response due to infection has posed an additional challenge. Our approach indicates that seroprevalence on Canadian blood donors by the end of March 2021was less than 10\%. Our study supports the use of latent class analysis in upcoming public health crises, epidemics, and pandemics when a gold standard assay may not be available or identifiable.},
