NOTES:

-   To render both word and HTML, can type this into terminal

quarto render 5_manuscript/manuscript.qmd

-   There are limits in cross-referencing in Quarto. The table
   Caption doesn't work well with flextable package, and 
  There's no option for secondary (supplemental) series of 
  tables or figures. As workaround, we repurpose other
  series.I'm using
        @thm- for tables (Table X)
        @cor- for supplemental tables (Table SX)
        @lem- for supplemental figures (Figure SX)
  The space between "S" and the number for supplemental figures seems unavoidable
   for now. Can manually correct before submitting to journal.
        
Flextable package isn't playing nicely with quarto for crossreferencing at the 
moment but it's being actively worked on. To install latest package version, use 
  devtools::install_github("davidgohel/flextable")

# Abstract

**Background:** Studies estimating population prevalence of infectious disease markers in blood sometimes ask participants to self-collect and mail a dried blood spot (DBS) for laboratory testing, instead of having a venous blood samples collected by a trained health professional. Many SARS-CoV-2 serological studies have used DBS, and limited data are available on whether DBS changes laboratory findings.

**Methods:** In a national SARS-CoV-2 serological study of older Canadians, participants could choose whether to mail a DBS sample or provide an venous sample at a testing center. We developed a propensity score model to identify whether variables related to demographics, geography, and health were related to choice of DBS or venous sample. We used propensity score weighting to adjust for potential confounding variables and compare SARS-CoV-2 Anti-N and Anti-S assay results when using the same assay on DBS or venous samples.

**Results:** Participants choosing to provide in-person venous samples were more likely to be male, white, unvaccinated, and living in an urban area. After propensity score weighting, venous samples were 223% more likely to be Anti-N positive (OR: 3.33, 95% CI: 2.78 - 4.01) and 27% more likely to be Anti-S positive (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.49). Among samples that tested positive for Anti-S antibodies, venous samples had significantly higher quantitative anti-S levels.

**Conclusions:** In a large Canadian study, we found that DBS was associated with lower positivity rates and quantitative antibody levels for SARS-CoV-2 compared to venous samples, even after controlling for potential confounding variables. Our findings contrast with prior reports that serological tests perform similarly in DBS and venous samples and suggest that more work is needed to understand how different assays perform on DBS samples.

# Introduction

-   DBS convenient and increasingly used

-   Studies suggest similar performance

-   We used data from ... in which participants self-selected between DBS vs VBS. We analyzed factors associated with particiants' decision to provide a home DBS sample vs. in person venous sample, and analyzed differences in assay results after adjusting for potential confounders with propensity score weighting.

### Sampling Methods:

DBS and VBS

## Dataset

The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) is a comprehensive national long-term study designed to track approximately 50,000 individuals aged 45 to 85 years at recruitment for a minimum of 20 years \[citation for CLSA\]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies were conducted to collect and analyze blood samples from CLSA participants, aimed at comprehending and evaluating the pandemic's population-level health impact.\
The dataset utilized in this study was sourced from the CLSA COVID-19 Antibody Study, with over 19,000 CLSA participants across ten provinces included \[Insert citation here\]. The dataset comprises demographic information, self-reported health status, vaccination and hospitalization history, and the results of SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay tests.

The CLSA COVID-19 Antibody Study has two complementary cohorts. The first one is called "comprehensive cohort", in which 17,399 participants were invited and 9,753 of them agreed to participant and provided testable samples with complete results. Within this group, N=4,258 contributed venous blood samples, and N=5,495 provided dried blood samples. Participants in the comprehensive cohort were randomly selected from locations within 25-50 km of the data collection sites (DCS) and underwent in-person interviews, providing detailed information on demographics, physical and mental health status, as well as vaccination and hospitalization history. The second cohort, known as the "tracking cohort," was interviewed by telephone. For our analysis, we will exclusively utilize data from the comprehensive cohort (N\>9,753), as it provides more comprehensive demographic and health condition data.

## Bivariate Analysis and Multivariate Regression Modeling

Before conducting propensity score weighting to calculate weights for each observations and analyze the weighted data, we performed an initial unadjusted bivariate analysis to compare the DBS and VBS groups. Additionally, we developed multivariate logistic regression models, regressing VBS/DBS against demographic factors, physical and mental health conditions, travel distance, vaccination status, and time since the last COVID outbreak. The comprehensive results generated by those simple logistic regression models and the full model are displayed in **Table X** and the odds ratio plot (**Fig. X**).

Upon completion of the full model, we constructed a best-fit model utilizing a backward stepwise model selection strategy. The model with lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value was selected as the best-fit model. Subsequently, we applied this best-fit model to calculate propensity scores for the selection of VBS over DBS. Participants from both groups will then be weighteded based on their propensity scores using Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW).

## Analysis with Weighted Data

To analyze the variation in quantitative Anti-S immunoassay results, we employed the weighted empirical cumulative distribution function (eCDF) to visualize the distribution in the matched DBS and VBS cohorts (**Fig. Y**). We used Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test to assess whether the distributions are statistically-significantly different. Additionally, we utilized odds ratios to present differences in Anti-N and Anti-S assay positivity (**Table Y**).

The .bib file in the same folder as the .qmd file is for providing the biblography for us to cite when write. It is recommended to put all the citations in one folder (collection) and create .bib file from it. Another solution is creating seperate .bib file and merge them manually using Notepad+++. Anyway, the YAML chunk at the top of this file is only capable for loading ONLY ONE .bib file.

Addtional resolution for multiple .bib files: merge all the bib into one, see codes at the begginning of this file.

The codes below "::: {#refs}" is for indicating the place where we should put biblographies
